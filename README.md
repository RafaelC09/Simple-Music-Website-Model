# Overview

Simple Music Website Model is a modular music website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is designed for easy use.

# Features

It has some features, just like:

- An artist model, if you want to add more its just copy the code for the example artist and edit some CSS
- An music model, if you want to add more its doing the same step I said above but for music
- Dark mode
- Music player
- Artists biography
- Sign up(still unfunctional)
- Playlists(still unfunctional)


# Notes

This project is an amateur project by an programming student, so it doesnt have the best quality, but I believe you can export some things from this project. I hope this project can help you doing an website.
